# Phaser with `edict`

This isn't really a game so much as a stress test for
`edict` to set a baseline for game dev. 

> Current state: I don't think `edict` is performant enough
> to be on a core 60fps game loop. I'm pretty sure to reach that goal
> I'll have to fork and rebuild the core `rete` engine specifically for gamedev. 
> However, for use-cases that don't require rules be triggered every frame it's
> perfectly fine

# Running the app
