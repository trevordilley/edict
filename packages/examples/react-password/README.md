# Password validation by rules
Password validation is a familiar requirement for anyone who has implemented
a web application on either the client or the server.

Password validation is a great way to illustrate the value of rules in an application!
* The example is familiar
* The example is self-contained
* The requirements can be described clearly in a single sentence
* More requirements can be added or removed without considering the other requirements
* The input is a single string, with a single output (the validity of the password.)

This example takes a set of common requirements and implements each as an independent rule. You can find the relevant source in [rules.ts](src/app/rules.ts).
