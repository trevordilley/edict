# Examples
Contained in this directory are examples exercising the 
usage of `edict` in various ways. 

As `edict` develops more examples will be added here. 

To run these examples, please refer to the root `package.json` and look
for the appropriate scripts. They are generally of the pattern

`npm run examples:*` so should be easy to figure out.
