# Edict
Edict is a simple state management library exposing an ergonomic API separating data from logic. 
Edict takes a rule-based approach when determining how to reactively update state. 

The API and underlying motivations were inspired by the [O'doyle rules](https://github.com/oakes/odoyle-rules) library. Edict aims to 
expose an API which follows the reactive spirit of the O'doyle Rules library.
