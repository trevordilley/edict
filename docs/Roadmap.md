# Roadmap
## 2022

### Release "0.1.0-alpha" and ensure README makes it clear it's in alpha
Mention future potential API changes, specifically typesafe
id's, inserts, and retractions

## Q1 - 2023

### Create @edict/react library....
The useRule and provider are complex enough folks shouldn't expect to do this
themselves. 

### Improve Debugging Tooling
Specifically, visualizations around how rules are being triggered, and why

### Make Id's part of the schema 
Right now it's possible to make a typo in an Id. I have an API that I think
would fix this. It'll be a breaking change to a pretty different API, but I
think it'll be worth it.

### Release 0.1.0-beta 
Do the last bits of sprucing up

## Q2 - 2023

### Gather feedback and bug fixing

## Q3 - 2023

### Release 1.0.0
Yay!!!
