# Contributing
Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

## Contributions
Please feel free to contribute PR's, though if you wanna do something 
radical you might want to start with a github issue to make sure it lines up
with the authors vision. Of course feel free to fork and run with it!

If you have suggestions, a github issue is great!

The author (me) will do his best to respond and review, though this project
is a subject to the schedules imposed on me by small children, so my ability to 
respond may not be particularly quick.

## Branching
I'm keeping it simple for now. `main` is the main branch, and PR's should branch off of `main`. 

## Code Formatting
The prettier config is in the codebase!

## Testing
It's really helpful if changes include a test!

## Setup
Execute the following

```
# Install the things from root
npm i

# Now you can do things
npm run test # runs all the tests
npm run  build # builds all the things
npm run example:phaser # Run the phaser example
npm run example:password # Run the password example!
npm run example:react # Run the react example!
npm run example:realworld # Run the conduit realworld example!
```
